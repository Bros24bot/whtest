    <p>Following a period of turbulence between January and March — during which several prominent alliances left the state — a major turning point arrived in April 2023: we successfully welcomed <strong>ODA</strong> from State 245. Their arrival marked a significant reinforcement. With their dedication and leadership, ODA played a key role in revitalizing and reorganizing State 214 alongside <strong>DOA</strong>, laying the groundwork for a new era of structure and stability.</p>

    <h2>State 214 officially launched in April 2023, stepping into the world of Whiteout Survival with fierce competition and dynamic leadership.</h2>

    <p>Like every great state, 214 faced its early challenges — power struggles, shifting alliances, and growing pains. But unlike many others, we quickly stabilized through diplomacy, teamwork, and the shared belief that community matters more than control.</p>

    <p>Through countless battles and events, 214 evolved into one of the most successful and respected states in the game. With strong coordination and alliance synergy, we’ve continued to grow together.</p>

    <h3>During the great state fusion in winter 2025, we welcomed amazing players from State 196. This merge was a breakthrough — boosting power, diversity, and ambition.</h3>

    <p>The community gained not only numbers, but passion. Together, we restructured and refined 214 into a modern, balanced and competitive powerhouse.</p>

    <h3>Recent Progress & Alliance Transitions</h3>
    <p>Just last month, a major shift happened: PBT made a successful alliance transition, joined by numerous skilled players during the most recent transfer window. These changes further pushed us forward.</p>

    <p>More importantly, this phase brought genuine friendships and a new layer of cohesion that continues to shape our state culture.</p>

    <h3>Future Vision – The Dream of 214</h3>
    <p>As we continue to grow, our collective ambition turns toward the ultimate challenge: the Frostdragon Tyrant. Our dream is not only to deploy three elite alliances in this high-stakes event — but to bring the Tyrant itself under the banner of State 214.</p>

    <p>Today, State 214 stands not just as a competitive force, but as a model of what can happen when players unite under a shared purpose.</p>

    <h3>Core Alliances – All Stars United</h3>
