    <h2>From Foundation to Frost: The Rise of State 214</h2>

    <p>State 214 officially launched in <span class="highlight">April 2023</span>, stepping into the world of <strong>Whiteout Survival</strong> with fierce competition and dynamic leadership.</p>

    <p>Like every great state, 214 faced its early challenges — power struggles, shifting alliances, and growing pains. But unlike many others, we quickly stabilized through diplomacy, teamwork, and the shared belief that <strong>community matters more than control</strong>.</p>

    <p>Through countless battles and events, 214 evolved into one of the most successful and respected states in the game. With strong coordination and alliance synergy, we’ve continued to grow together.</p>

    <h3>The Merge with State 196 – Winter 2025</h3>
    <p>During the great state fusion in winter 2025, we welcomed amazing players from <span class="highlight">State 196</span>. This merge was a breakthrough — boosting power, diversity, and ambition.</p>

    <p>The community gained not only numbers, but passion. Together, we restructured and refined 214 into a modern, balanced and competitive powerhouse.</p>

    <h3>Recent Progress & Alliance Transitions</h3>
    <p>Just last month, a major shift happened: <strong>PBT</strong> made a successful alliance transition, joined by numerous skilled players during the most recent transfer window. These changes further pushed us forward.</p>

    <p>But more importantly, this phase brought something deeper — <strong>genuine friendships</strong> and a new layer of cohesion that continues to shape our state culture.</p>

    <h3>Future Vision – The Dream of 214</h3>
    <p>As we continue to grow, our collective ambition turns toward the ultimate challenge: the <strong>Frostdragon Tyrant</strong>. Our dream is not only to deploy three elite alliances in this high-stakes event — but to bring the Tyrant itself under the banner of <span class="highlight">State 214</span>.</p>

    <p>This isn’t just about power. It's about proving what a united and well-organized community can achieve. Claiming the Frostdragon would mark a historic milestone and symbolize everything we’ve built together.</p>

    <p>Today, State 214 stands not just as a competitive force, but as a model of what can happen when players unite under a shared purpose. Together, we rise — and our next goal is clear: <strong>to bring the Frostdragon home</strong>.</p>
