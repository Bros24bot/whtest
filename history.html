    <h2>From Foundation to Frost: The Rise of State 214</h2>

    <p>State 214 officially launched in <span class="highlight">April 2023</span>, stepping into the world of <strong>Whiteout Survival</strong> with fierce competition and dynamic leadership.</p>

    <p>Like every great state, 214 faced its early challenges — power struggles, shifting alliances, and growing pains. But unlike many others, we quickly stabilized through diplomacy, teamwork, and the shared belief that <strong>community matters more than control</strong>.</p>

    <p>Through countless battles and events, 214 evolved into one of the most successful and respected states in the game. With strong coordination and alliance synergy, we’ve continued to grow together.</p>

    <h3>The Merge with State 196 – Winter 2025</h3>
    <p>During the great state fusion in winter 2025, we welcomed amazing players from <span class="highlight">State 196</span>. This merge was a breakthrough — boosting power, diversity, and ambition.</p>

    <p>The community gained not only numbers, but passion. Together, we restructured and refined 214 into a modern, balanced and competitive powerhouse.</p>

    <h3>Recent Progress & Future Goals</h3>
    <p>Just last month, a major shift happened: <strong>PBT</strong> made a successful alliance transition, joined by numerous skilled players during the most recent transfer window. These changes further pushed us forward.</p>

    <p>Today, our sights are set on the <strong>Frost Tyrant</strong> — not only deploying 3 top alliances, but claiming the Frost Tyrant itself in the name of <span class="highlight">State 214</span>.</p>

    <h3>Core Alliances – All Stars United</h3>
